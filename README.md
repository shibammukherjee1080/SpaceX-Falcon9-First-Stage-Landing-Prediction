# SpaceX-Falcon9-First-Stage-Landing-Prediction

In this capstone of IBM Data Science specialisation, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. In this lab, you will collect and make sure the data is in the correct format from an API. The following is an example of a successful and launch.

This project is completed in 7 total steps which are as follows:
1. From FAST API of SpaceX , Data was collected
2. Using Web Scraping the Falcon-9's data was trasnformed into a dataframe
3. Lots of Data Wrangling , cleaning and transforming and making the data ready for Exploratory Data Analysis and building the best prediciton model.
4. SQL Lite is used to answer Business Questions in the given tasks
5. Data is vizualised to get insights from the Flacon 9 tests conducted by SpaceX.
6. Built the most optimal and accurate model to predict if the Falcon9 will land or not.
   (Several models were tested like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, KNN , SVM etc.)
7. A report was built concluding the findings , the Machine learning model and that marks the end of the Capstone Project.
